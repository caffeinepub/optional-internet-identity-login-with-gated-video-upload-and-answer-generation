# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the pre-login landing page (unauthenticated EmptyState view) tagline to the new, exact wording.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the EmptyState (pre-login landing page) tagline text to exactly: “An AI-powered detective tool.”
- Ensure the previous longer tagline (“An AI-powered detective tool to uncover hidden riddles from your clues”) no longer appears on the pre-login landing page.

**User-visible outcome:** When not authenticated, users see the pre-login landing page with the tagline “An AI-powered detective tool.” and the old longer tagline is no longer shown.
