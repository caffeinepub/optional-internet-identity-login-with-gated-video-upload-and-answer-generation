      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "The 'Generate Answer' output area correctly displays multi-line text (including blank lines) returned by the backend without truncation.",
        "Any user-facing descriptions in the answer-generation UI that imply 'analyze riddle text' should be updated to explicitly say it generates a 'full solution' (English text).",
        "The existing frontend safeguard that detects an echoed riddle remains compatible (i.e., should not falsely trigger for valid full-solution responses)."

          "description": "Update the shadcn/ui Card copy (title/description/labels) to explicitly describe generating a full solution (final answer + explanation) rather than restating/analyzing the riddle. Replace the current read-only Textarea output with a read-only display that preserves whitespace (including blank lines) using a non-input element (e.g., a container with whitespace-preserving styling) and supports long multi-paragraph text without truncation (allow full height and/or scrolling). Keep the echoed-riddle safeguard logic but harden it to also treat empty/whitespace-only backend responses as invalid while ensuring it only flags exact trimmed matches (to avoid false positives for valid solutions). Use existing shadcn/ui components already imported/composed; verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."

Keep existing layout and composition; do not change restricted hook files or shadcn/ui internals. Verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
